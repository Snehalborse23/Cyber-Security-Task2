** Task 02 — Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation****

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to **image encryption and decryption** using **pixel-level manipulation** in Python. The main goal is to protect image data from unauthorized access by transforming its pixel values into an unreadable form.

### ⚙️ Working Principle  
- The program loads an image and reads all its pixel values (RGB format).  
- For **encryption**, it applies a basic mathematical operation (like addition, subtraction, or XOR) or swaps pixel positions to change the color pattern of the image.  
- The output is a scrambled image that cannot be visually interpreted.  
- For **decryption**, the reverse operation is applied to restore the original image.

### 💡 Features  
- Supports both **encryption and decryption**.  
- Uses **simple pixel manipulation techniques** to alter image data.  
- Demonstrates how cryptography can be applied in **image processing**.  
- Provides an **educational and ethical** way to understand the basics of image security.

### 🖼️ Example Use Case  
1. User selects an image file (e.g., `photo.png`).  
2. The tool encrypts the image by modifying pixel values.  
3. The encrypted image looks distorted and unreadable.  
4. Running the decryption function restores the original image.
